Windows console attach has bizarre side effects:

- If STARTF_USESTDHANDLES is specified, console leaves the standard handles alone

- Otherwise, it resets the standard handles to the console every time you attach!

- However, even in the STARTF_USESTDHANDLES case, if one of the
  standard handles is NULL, we actually set that standard handle
  anyway
